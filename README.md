# LPvis ðŸ•º
> Pronounce: "Elpvis" | A land parcel visualizer powered by a lightweight Leaflet map

Use LPvis to visualize the results of crop type classifications in comparison to IACS/CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) declarations. Simple traffic light symbology shows computed conformity and tooltips and a data table let you dig deeper into the data.

## Prerequisites

LPvis expects LPIS (Land-Parcel Identification System) data and administrative boundaries as vector tiles in `.pbf` (Protobuf) format. They must be served as tile directories using a `ZXY`-scheme.

### Example using Austrian LPIS/IACS data

1. Download [agricultural parcels](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/e21a731f-9e08-4dd3-b9e5-cd460438a5d9), [phyical blocks](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/b9cab416-896b-408a-8665-9f4ac30f79db) and [municipalities](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/566c99be-b436-365e-af4f-27be6c536358) as `shp`.
- Transform them in QGIS to `EPSG:4326` (required by [`tippecanoe`](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe)).
- Join classification results to agricultural parcels.
- Export as `gpkg`.
- Pipe `gpkg` with `fiona` to [`tippecanoe`](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe). E.g.:
```shell
fio cat agricultural_parcels.gpkg | tippecanoe --drop-densest-as-needed --read-parallel --minimum-zoom=14 --maximum-zoom=18 --output=agricultural_parcels.mbtiles -f
```
6. Serve `mbtiles` with [`tileserver-gl-light`](https://github.com/klokantech/tileserver-gl).

## Installation / Getting started

1. Download the source files.
2. Start a simple development server (e.g. using Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`).
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

The above steps will let you view LPvis in your browser. Most probably you will have to make some configurations before LPIS data and administrative boundaries show up.

### Initial Configuration

Replace the URLs in `main.js` with the ones pointing to your hosted tile directories. You should also adapt the respective `attribution` options further down in the code.

```javascript
const AGRICULTURAL_PARCELS_URL_TEMPLATE = 'http://localhost:8080/data/agricultural_parcels/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf'
const PHYSICAL_BLOCKS_URL_TEMPLATE = 'http://localhost:8080/data/physical_blocks/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf'
const MUNICIPALITIES_URL_TEMPLATE = 'http://localhost:8080/data/municipalities/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf'
```

NUTS administrative boundaries are used to automatically center LPvis on the area of interest. A good source is [Eurostat's Nuts2json](https://github.com/eurostat/Nuts2json), but you can also replace the URL with the path to a local GeoJSON. `NUTS_LEVEL` and `NUTS_CODE_STARTS_WITH` are used to specify the administrative level and filter by NUTS code, respectively. They only apply to GeoJSONs from Nuts2json.

```javascript
const NUTS_LEVEL = 3
const NUTS_CODE_STARTS_WITH = 'AT'
const NUTS2_GEOJSON_URL = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurostat/Nuts2json/gh-pages/2016/4258/10M/nutsrg_${NUTS_LEVEL}.json`
```

The unique identifier as given in the data attributes must be specified too or symbology and tooltips will get messed up. The tooltips might need additional configuration (search for `setTooltipContent` in the code).

```javascript
const AGRICULTURAL_PARCELS_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER = 'ID'
const PHYSICAL_BLOCKS_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER = 'RFL_ID'
```

For the peak-through feature to work in other countries than Austria, you will have to change this URL too:

```javascript
const ORTHOPHOTO_URL_TEMPLATE = 'https://maps{s}.wien.gv.at/basemap/bmaporthofoto30cm/normal/google3857/{z}/{y}/{x}.jpeg'
```
### Configure traffic light symbology

When the confidence in the classification of a parcel lies below a certain threshold, it is coloured in yellow. You can configure this value in `main.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 95
```


## Features

* Visualize crop type classification vs. declaration using traffic light symbology
* Tooltips show detailed information on parcels when you mouseover them
* Populate data table by clicking on parcels and export attributes as CSV
* Overlay parcels with reference areas by swiping
* Peak-through to ground truth and view the orthophoto
* EOX Terrain Light or Sentinel-2 Cloudless 2018 basemaps
* Minimap providing an overview area using OpenStreetMap data
